    "Write a Python script that takes a Scrabble rack **as a command-line argument** and prints all valid Scrabble words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. Valid Scrabble words are provided in the data source below.  A Scrabble rack is made up of any 7 characters.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- This needs to be able to be **run as a command line tool** as you'll see below.\n",

    "- Allow a user to specify that a certain letter has to be at a certain location. Your program must work without it so this should be completely optional. For the extra credit, locations of certain letters must be specified at the command line, **it may not be some sort of user prompt.**\n",

    "## Tips\n",
    "We recommend that you work on this and try to break down the problems into steps on your own before writing any code. Once you've scoped generally what you want to do, start writing some code and if you get stuck, take a step back and go back to thinking about the problem rather than trying to fix lots of errors at the code level. You should only use the Python standard library in this assignment, however any tool in the Python standard library is fair game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips Part 2\n",
    "If you keep getting stuck check out: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge. This is where we got the idea for this assignment and it provides some helpful tips for guiding you along the way. If that link doesn't work you can use the [google cached version here](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge). However, we would sincerely recommend that you try to implement this first yourself before looking at the hints on the website.\n",

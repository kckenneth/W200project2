    "Python is easy to learn and use. Data scientists are generally people who aren’t purely software engineers, and they prefer ease of programming in order to do their job quickly and with the greatest convenience. python also has numerous libraries that provide the needed functionality for scientific computations and data analysis, such as numpy and pandas. Python is also very convenient when you need to redesign your code. For example, you want to add features later, or completely redesign the inner logic, or change the codes for something different - python is nice for this."

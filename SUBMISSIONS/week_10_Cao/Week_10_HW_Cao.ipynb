    "## Reading and Writing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be reading and writing data. Yes, finally some data science (or at least some exploratory data analysis)! In the week_10 assignment folder, there are three data files ending in `csv`, `json` and `pkl` named: \n",
    "\n",
    "* data.csv\n",
    "* data.json\n",
    "* data.pkl\n",
    "\n",
    "These are three common types of file formats that exist for storing data. You can run the following **on the bash command line** to see what is in each file (this will not work from a Windows prompt but will work in git bash):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "head data.csv # (or .pkl or .json )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that there is some method to the madness but that each file has its peculiarities. Each file contains a portion of the total dataset that consists of 100 records, so you will need to **read in all of the files and combine them into some standard format** with which you are comfortable. Aim for something standard where each \"row\" is the same format.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've standardized all of the data, report the following bits of information by **writing them to a .csv file** labelled `question_1.csv`, `question_2.csv` etc. There needs to be separate .csv files for each question below. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a script to examine and grade your .csv files - make sure the answers are all in one **column** with one answer entry per cell, sorted as stated in the question below.  (That is: looking at the .csv in a spreadsheet editor like Google Sheets all answers would be in the 'A' column, with the first entry in A1, the second in A2 etc). It is strongly recommended that you open each .csv file to ensure the answers are there and displayed correctly! \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, show all of your work in this **Jupyter notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the unique countries in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?\n",
    "2. What are the unique email domains in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?\n",

You can use `pandas` to independently check your work if you are so inclined but do not use `pandas` as the sole solution method. Don't worry if you are not familiar with `pandas`.  We will do this homework as a class exercise using `pandas` in the near future."

    "- There are many data structures and formats that you might use to solve this problem.  You will have to decide if you want to keep the information for each person together as one record or all the information for each of the fields together.\n",
    "- You can put these files into sensible structures such as lists or or dictionaries. The async covers how to do this for csv and json. For pickle this might help https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle \n",

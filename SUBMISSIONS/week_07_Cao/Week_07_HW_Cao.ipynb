This might not really apply to the work that you are doing now but should provide some food for thought on upcoming projects. Think about the author's perspective and why he seems to have come to it. Please don't worry about knowing all the terminology or programs/systems that he refers to.

    "As a new programmer who just started the journey, I'm surprised to learn that the software/codes we wrote change all the time, and soon become legacy. The author is telling us that the strategies he learned from his real experiences are not about writing good software, but how to build software that can change over time. He listed a few good strategies such as layering, isolation, common interfaces, composition (the terminologies that I don't understand now and I think I will learn in the near future).  The most interesting part to me is that \"Being able to write new code without dealing with old code makes it far easier to experiment with new ideas.\" I seem starting  to understand this. \n"

In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right.\n",

When a marble reaches row N-1 at the bottom of the box, it should not move any more.  Note that you should simply allow marbles to occupy the same position (instead of working out a system to prevent a Marble from entering a position if another Marble is already there).\n",

Specifically, it is a Binomial distribution with parameters N and 0.5.  As you let N grow larger and larger, the Binomial distribution will approach the famous Normal distribution that you will see over and over in parametric statistics.  This is a consequence of an extremely important result known as the Central Limit Theorem."

    "## Part 5 - Sorting Marbles\n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, there are N spaces in a row, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right. There are also N marbles, numbered 0 through N - 1, initially placed in some arbitrary order. After that, there are two moves available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch: Switch the marbles in positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Rotate: Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower).\n",
    "The objective is to arrange the marbles in order, with each marble i in position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Write a class, MarblesBoard, to represent the game above. The class should be initialized with a particular sequence of Marbles.  Write an \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function that takes a starting sequence of marbles (the number of each marble listed in the positions from 0 to N - 1).\n",
    "Next, write switch() and rotate() methods to simulate the player's moves. Write a method, is_solved(), that returns True if the marbles are in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may want to write \\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ methods that display the current state of the board. Your class should behave like the following example.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board = MarblesBoard((3,6,7,4,1,0,8,2,5)) \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 6 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "6 3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.rotate() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 6 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "7 3 4 1 0 8 2 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Write a second class, Solver, that actually plays the MarblesGame. You class should take a MarblesBoard in its initializer. Write a solve() method that repeatedly calls the switch() and rotate() methods of the given MarblesBoard until the game is solved.  You should print the state of the board after each move.  Additionally, print out the total number of moves at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to come up with your own algorithm for solving the marbles game.  Before you write your solve() method, you may want to practice solving some small versions of the marbles game yourself.  Here is an example of using a Solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\n",
    ">>> solver = Solver(board2)\n",
    ">>> solver.solve()\n",
    "1 3 0 2 \n",
    "3 0 2 1 \n",
    "0 2 1 3 \n",
    "2 1 3 0 \n",
    "1 2 3 0 \n",
    "2 3 0 1 \n",
    "3 0 1 2 \n",
    "0 1 2 3 \n",
    "total steps: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Solver does not that to follow the fastest possible running time, but you should strive to make it reasonably efficient.  When you are done, compute the (tightest) big-O running time bound for your script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be interested to know that your program is a variation of a well-known sorting algorithm called bubble sort.  Bubble sort would normally be used on a list of items, not on a rotating track, but adapting your algorithm to this setting would be easy."
